# Methane-Emission-EDA
Data cleaning and EDA is a crucial step in understanding the data and  a data scientist should be fleunt in it. In this project, iPython is used to clean, explore and visualize the methane emission data.

* Creating an interactive searchable widget

Methane emission by region was plotted for the year 2012 and 1970, showing North America to still be the largest emitter of methane. Further, a filter was created to choose a specific country or region and plot its emission over the year. In the end, an interactive UI is created which utilizes the filter function to give the output of the desired country/region.
